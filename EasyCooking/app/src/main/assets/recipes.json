    "about": "One of the most famous Chinese desserts is the classic egg tart, a delicious pastry consisting of a flaky outer shell with a creamy, but firm egg custard in the center. The origin of this traditional Chinese dessert is vague.",
    "ingredients": [
      "Custard Filling:",
      "4 eggs (reserve 2 tablespoons for pastry dough)",
      "180 mL hot water",
      "6 tablespoons (~75 g) sugar",
      "⅛ teaspoon salt",
      "60 mL evaporated milk",
      "A dash of vanilla extract (optional)",
      "",
      "Pastry Dough:",
      "200 g cake flour (plus extra for dusting)",
      "115 g unsalted butter (at room temperature)",
      "40 g powdered sugar",
      "2 tablespoons beaten egg (from the custard filling eggs)",
      "⅛ teaspoon salt",
      "A dash of vanilla extract (optional)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "For the pastry, in a large bowl, sift flour, sugar, and salt. Then add softened butter. Bring the mixture together with your hands, careful not to knead the pastry dough too much or you will make the pastry tough. \n Whisk the egg yolks and add the 2 tablespoons of beaten yolk to the flour mixture. Bring together until smooth. If the dough is too sticky, coating your hands with flour will help. Cover with plastic wrap and then refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until the dough is firm. \n To make the custard filling, melt sugar and salt with hot water. Mix until dissolved then let cool. \n Add the rest of the beaten egg yolk. Stir in sugar water and also evaporated milk (if adding vanilla, add now). Stir and combine everything well. \n Strain the filling to ensure no lumps. Chill in the refrigerator. \n Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). \n Take the dough out and divide into 16 equal portions. Spray the tart pan with a light coating of oil. Take one portion of your dough and roll it into a ball and place in your tart shell. Press the shell into the pan with your fingers. Try to make the wrapper uniform in thickness and avoid a thick bottom. Repeat to finish all. \n Pour the custard filling into the shells until it is about 80% full. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the surface becomes golden brown and a toothpick can stand in the egg tart. \n Cool down for several minutes and then take the egg tarts out of the pan. Serve while still warm."

    "recipeInstructions": "Matcha Mascarpone Cream: Fill a pot with about 1 inch of water and bring it to a boil. In a large mixing bowl that fits into the pot without touching the water, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar. \n When the water starts boiling, turn off the heat and place the bowl on top of the pot to create a double boiler. Continuously whisk the egg mixture until the sugar dissolves and it becomes pale in color, about 5 minutes. \n Remove the bowl from the pot and immediately add in the softened mascarpone cheese. Whisk together until smooth and silky. Set aside. \n In a separate mixing bowl, add the whipping cream, matcha powder, and vanilla extract. Use an electric hand mixer with a whisk attachment to whip the cream until it reaches medium peaks. It should have structure and leave trails but still be fluid and not completely stiff. \n Add the whipped cream to the mascarpone mixture and fold together with a spatula until no streaks remain. Set aside. \n Matcha Soak: In a shallow bowl, combine matcha powder, granulated sugar, and hot water. Use a matcha whisk, milk frother, or regular whisk to whisk until slightly frothy, about 30 seconds. \n Very briefly dip a ladyfinger in the matcha soak just enough to coat both sides. Let any excess drip off. Do NOT let it sit in the liquid or soak all the way through or it will quickly turn into mush. Place the ladyfinger in the bottom of a serving container. Repeat until you have a flat, even layer of ladyfingers. \n Add a generous layer of mascarpone cream on top of the ladyfingers and use a spatula to smooth it evenly. \n Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and another layer of mascarpone cream. \n Cover and chill your matcha tiramisu in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the cream to firm up and ladyfingers to soften. \n Topping: Right before serving, sprinkle the top of your tiramisu with matcha powder."
